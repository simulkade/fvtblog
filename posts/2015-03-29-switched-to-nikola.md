Today, I switched this blog from [Octopress](www.octopress.org) to [Nikola](www.getnikola.com). I did it mostly because I'm more comfortable with Python, and of course the new exciting version of ipython, which is now called [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). I think I'm going to stick to this format for a while.
