This is a very short post. [Kai](https://github.com/KaiSchu) implemented the [lid-driven cavity](http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Lid-Driven_Cavity_Problem) problem in FVTool, something that I couldn't have done soon or perhaps ever. You can find his implementation [here](https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool/tree/master/Examples/External/SteadyLidDrivenCavityProblem). This is a contour plot of the velocity profile:

In case you look into the files, please don't compare his programming style with mine. My style is quite embarrassing!
