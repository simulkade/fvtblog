This is my first post in Nikola.  
# This is one title
A body text, and some equations $b=\sin(a)$ and display equations like $$f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}$$ where x is nothing.  

## A subtitle
This is the second body text! Here I'm writing a lot of text to see how it looks like in my new theme.

## some codes
this is some julia code
```jl
using PyPlot
a = linspace(0,10,20)
b= sin(a)
plot(a,b)
```
