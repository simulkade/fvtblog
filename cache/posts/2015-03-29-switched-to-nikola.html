<p>Today, I switched this blog from <a href="www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> to <a href="www.getnikola.com">Nikola</a>. I did it mostly because I'm more comfortable with Python, and of course the new exciting version of ipython, which is now called <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. I think I'm going to stick to this format for a while.</p>
