<p>This is a very short post. <a href="https://github.com/KaiSchu">Kai</a> implemented the <a href="http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Lid-Driven_Cavity_Problem">lid-driven cavity</a> problem in FVTool, something that I couldn't have done soon or perhaps ever. You can find his implementation <a href="https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool/tree/master/Examples/External/SteadyLidDrivenCavityProblem">here</a>. This is a contour plot of the velocity profile:</p>

<p>In case you look into the files, please don't compare his programming style with mine. My style is quite embarrassing!</p>
